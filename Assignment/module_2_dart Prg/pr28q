28. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?
-> Dart does not have a syntax for declaring interfaces. Class declarations
 are themselves interfaces in Dart.
-> And to inherit the interface we need to write the keyword 'implements'.
-> So with keyword 'extend' we cannot inherit multiple interface as it will
denoted as multiple class inheritance. Thus it is not possible.
-> Instead of using extends keyword, we must use implements keyword to
inherit multiple interfaces.
