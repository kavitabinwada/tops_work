26. Can we overload static method in Dart?
-> In Dart, we cannot overload methods, including static methods by changing
  the number of parameters.
-> Because it is not supported in Dart unlike other programming languages.
-> when we define multiple methods with same name and different number of
 parameters,compiler considers them as redefining the same method but the
 last called method will be used.
