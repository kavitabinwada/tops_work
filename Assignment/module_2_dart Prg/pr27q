27. Can a class implement more than one interface?.Can a class extend more
 than one class in Dart?
-> Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces offering similar functionality
 without the complexities of multiple inheritance.
-> Dart uses class declarations to define interfaces, and classes implementing
these interfaces must fulfil the contract by implementing all the required
methods and instance variables. Multiple interfaces can be implemented by
a single class for added flexibility.
-> But a class cannot extend multiple classes as it refers to multiple
inheritance and Dart does not supports multiple inheritance because of problem
 such as Diamond problem.
