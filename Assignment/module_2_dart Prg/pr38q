38.How do you prevent overriding a Dart method without using the final
modifier?
-> One way to prevent overriding a Dart method without using the 'final'
 modifier is to mark the method as @nonVirtual.
-> The @nonVirtual annotation requires a package 'metal/metal.dart' that is
 to be imported.
-> This annotation is used to indicate that a method should not be overridden
by subclasses.
-> for example :
    import 'package:meta/meta.dart';
    class A{
        @nonVirtual
        void show(){        //show method cannot be overridden in any of its
        }                    //subclasses.
    }
