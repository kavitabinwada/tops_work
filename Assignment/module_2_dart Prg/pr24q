Q.Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.
A.inheritance: inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (sub class or
derived class) derived attributes and methods from an existing class.
polymorphism: polymorphism is combination of works 'poly' and morphs which
collectively  means many forms. polymorphism is the ability of objects of
different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.
 - It allows for flexibility and extensibility in the code by enabling
 objects to be treated as instances of their superclass, even when they
 are actually instances of subclasses.
