23. Difference between inheritance and encapsulation.Difference
between inheritance and abstraction.
A.
    Inheritance
    - Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class)
     derives attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class).
    - It promotes code re usability by allowing a subclass to inherit
      the properties and behavior of its superclass.
    Encapsulation
    - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the
     methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit (class),
     and restricting access to some of the object's components.
    - It helps in data hiding, reducing coupling, and improving
     code maintainability and security.
