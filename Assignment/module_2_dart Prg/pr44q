44. Can a superclass access subclass member?
A.In Dart, a superclass can not directly access subclass members. This is
because inheritance in dart follows a unidirectional relationship where subclass
inherit members from superclasses, but superclasses do not have direct access
 to members of their subclasses. Subclasses can access members of superclass
 through inheritance, but the reverse is not true.
