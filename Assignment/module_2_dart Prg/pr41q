41. What happens when a class implements two interfaces and both
declare field (variable) with same name?
A.In Dart if a class implement two interfaces that both declare a field with
the same name,it will result in a compile time error. This is because Dart does
not support multiple inheritance and does not provide a way to resolve conflict
when two interfaces define the same number.
