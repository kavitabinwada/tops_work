30. Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of
 the super class? Are static members inherited to sub classes?
-> We can pass an object of a subclass to a method that expects an object of
the superclass.
->This is because Dart supports subtype polymorphism, which means that a
subclass instance can be treated as an instance of its superclass.
-> This is useful for writing more generic code that can work with different
types of objects as long as they inherit from a common superclass.
