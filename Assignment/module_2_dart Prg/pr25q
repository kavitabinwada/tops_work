25. Can we override static method in Dart?
 In Dart, it is not possible to override a static method. Because a static
method is not capable of getting overridden.
-> Static methods, by definition, are not part of an instance's interface with
 its superclass, so they cannot be overridden in the traditional sense.
-> However, we can define a static method using the same name as of super class,
 but it will not be called as method overriding.
