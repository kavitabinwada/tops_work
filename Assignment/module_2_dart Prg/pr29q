29. What will happen if a class implements two interfaces and they both have
 a method with same name and signature?
-> If a class implements two interfaces having a method with the same name and
signature, the class will need to provide an implementation for that method
only once by overriding.
-> This is because Dart does not support method overloading based on the return
 type or number of parameters.
-> If the class provides an implementation for the method that satisfies the
requirements of both interfaces, then that implementation will be used for
 both interfaces.
-> Also, method overriding can be done only once in a class.
