43. Can a subclass static method hide superclass instance method?
A.Yes,in Dart a superclass instance method with the same name. this is known
a method hiding. When a subclass defines a static method with the same name as
an instance method in the subclass will hide the instance method in the super
class. This can lead to practical confusion so generally not recommended, a good
practice in object-oriented programming.
