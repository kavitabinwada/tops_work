   39. What are the rules of method overriding in Dart?
   Rules of method overriding are :
    -> The method name in subclass must be of the same name as in super class.
    -> @override annotation must be mentioned in the subclass before the method
    implementation.
    -> If the superclass method is marked as @nonVirtual, it cannot be overridden
    in the subclass.
    -> Also, the method in superclass should not have any private modifier like
    (_methodName).
    -> super keyword can be used to target the elements and methods of super
    class.
