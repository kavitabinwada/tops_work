45. Difference between object oriented and object based language.
A.In object oriented programming, the key concepts are classes and objects.
object-oriented languages support features like inheritance,encapsulation and
polymorphism.Dart is an object-oriented language as it support these features.
In contrast, object based programming is a programming paradigm where every
this is treated as an object, but it may not necessarily support all the
features of object oriented programming. object base language typically do not
support features like inheritance or polymorphism.
