32. How do you restrict a member of a class from inheriting by its sub classes?
-> We can restrict a member of a class from being inherited by its subclasses by
marking that member as final.
-> When a member is marked as final, it cannot be overridden or inherited by
any subclasses.
-> This effectively restricts the member from being modified or extended in
any way by subclasses.
