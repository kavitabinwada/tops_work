 31. What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with same
identifier? Are constructors and initializers also inherited to sub classes?
-> In Dart, if both the parent and the child class have a field with the same
 identifier, the child class will hide the field of the parent class. This
 is known as field shadowing.
-> When you access the field from an instance of the child class, it will
refer to the field in the child class, not the parent class.
-> Constructors are not inherited in Dart. However, if a subclass does not
 define any constructors, it implicitly inherits the default constructor
from its superclass.
-> This means that if the superclass has a default constructor, the
subclass will also have a default constructor.
-> In Dart, initializers are not inherited by subclasses.
